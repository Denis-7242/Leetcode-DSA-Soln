## ⚙️ Implementation

### 🛠️ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Denis-7242/leetcode-101-symmetric-tree.git
cd leetcode-101-symmetric-tree
```

2. Compile and run:
```bash
javac Solution.java
java Solution
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) – every node is visited once
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) – recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree

## 📌 Notes
- The solution uses recursion to check if the left and right subtrees are mirror images
