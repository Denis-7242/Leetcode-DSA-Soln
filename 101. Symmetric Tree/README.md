# 101. Symmetric Tree (Java Solution)

## 🎯 Problem Overview
This repository contains my Java solution for the LeetCode problem:  
**[101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)**

## 📝 Problem Description
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a **mirror of itself** (i.e., symmetric around its center).

## 📋 Examples

## ⚙️ Implementation

1. Compile and run:
```bash
javac Solution.java
java Solution
```

## 📊 Complexity Analysis
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) – every node is visited once
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) – recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree

## 📌 Notes
- The solution uses recursion to check if the left and right subtrees are mirror images
