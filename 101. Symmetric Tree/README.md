# 101. Symmetric Tree (Java Solution)

This repository contains my Java solution for the LeetCode problem:  
**[101. Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)**

---

## ðŸ“Œ Problem Description
Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a **mirror of itself** (i.e., symmetric around its center).

---

### Example 1:

ðŸ›  How to Run

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/Denis-7242/leetcode-101-symmetric-tree.git
cd leetcode-101-symmetric-tree

Compile and run:

javac Solution.java
java Solution

ðŸ“– Notes

The solution uses recursion to check if the left and right subtrees are mirror images.

Time Complexity: O(n) â€“ every node is visited once.

Space Complexity: O(h) â€“ recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree.
